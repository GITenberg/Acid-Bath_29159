description: The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments in his
  singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid. But nothing like the weird twenty-one-day
  liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues. Unlike the usual style of audio
  book, this release has a music and effects soundtrack backing the narration giving
  it a radio play feel rather than a straightforward reading. Garson's sci-fi adventure
  story set in the outskirts of the Solar System.
